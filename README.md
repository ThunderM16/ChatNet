## Theme Control
> A lot of chats offer simple dark & light mode but not much more. With ChatNet get more out of your chat with css control.

## Developer?
> With ChatNet On Revolt you get access to Bots & API. Create to your hearts content.

## Security
> Keep track of what devices are logged in and even log-out of another device from any currently signed in device.

## Voice Calling
> Yes we have voice calling but not screen sharing ChatNet On Revolt will take time to get to that milestone but maybe with your help! We all could get there sooner.
